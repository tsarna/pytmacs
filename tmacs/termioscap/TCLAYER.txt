Intro
-----

The tmacs.termioscap (short for termios+termcap) layer is the low-level
platform specific part of the character cell editing user interface.
It deals with setting terminal modes, using information from the termcap
(or terminfo) database to provide terminal-independant terminal
functions, and converting from multibyte sequences to since characters
for cursor keys and the like.

For testing we will use a pipe to run the layer on so we can control the
input and check the output::

    >>> import os
    >>> f1, f2 = os.pipe()

We also need a reactor. Since we are testing TCLayer and not the
reactor, we'll use a fake one that will do our bidding::

    >>> from tmacs.termioscap.test import FakeReactor
    >>> r = FakeReactor()

The TCLayer class is provided by the tmacs.termioscap package::
        
    >>> from tmacs.termioscap import TCLayer

Now we create the TCLayer. Note the "Readed added" output -- that's from
the `addReader()` method of the `FakeReactor`::
    
    >>> tc = TCLayer(f1, 1, r, 'vt100', 'utf8')
    Reader added

Note that because of restrictions in the underlying POSIX facilities,
only one TCLayer can be created::

    >>> tc2 = TCLayer(f1, 1, r, 'vt100', 'utf8')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    OSError: only one instance allowed due to termcap
    

Input
-----

The TCLayer will have a Queue for events::

    >>> tc.queue
    <Queue.Queue instance at ...>

There will be an event pending at the start::

    >>> tc._evpending()
    True

Which is a the initial `<WindowResize>`::

    >>> from tmacs.ui.keys import repr_keysym
    >>> ev = tc._getevent()
    >>> (repr_keysym(ev[0]), ev[1])
    (u'<WindowResize>', (80, 24))

Now that we got it, there will not be another event pending::

    >>> tc._evpending()
    False
    
Simple characters input translate thrrough directly::

    >>> os.write(f2, "x")
    1
    >>> tc.doRead()
    >>> tc._evpending()
    True
    >>> ev = tc._getevent()
    >>> ev
    (u'x', None)

Events are always a 2-tuple of a single unicode character event code and
an associated value or None.

Since we set utf8 as the terminal encoding, we can feed the layer utf8
byte sequences and receive back the single character::

    >>> seq = u'\u2550'.encode('utf8')
    >>> os.write(f2, seq)
    3
    >>> tc.doRead()
    >>> tc._evpending()
    True
    >>> ev = tc._getevent()
    >>> ev
    (u'\u2550', None)
    >>> tc._evpending()
    False
     
The bytes don't have to all arrive at once, either::

    >>> os.write(f2, seq[0])
    1
    >>> tc.doRead()
    >>> os.write(f2, seq[1:])
    2
    >>> tc.doRead()
    >>> tc._evpending()
    True
    >>> ev = tc._getevent()
    >>> ev
    (u'\u2550', None)
    >>> tc._evpending()
    False

Although they must arrive before the timeout fires::

    >>> os.write(f2, seq[:2])
    2
    >>> tc.doRead()
    >>> r.itsLater() # causes previous callback to expire & fire
    >>> os.write(f2, seq[2:])
    1
    >>> tc.doRead()
    >>> tc._evpending()
    True
    >>> ev = tc._getevent()
    >>> (repr_keysym(ev[0]), ev[1])
    (u'<IllegalSequence>', '\xe2\x95')
    >>> tc._evpending()
    True
    >>> ev = tc._getevent()
    >>> (repr_keysym(ev[0]), ev[1])
    (u'<IllegalSequence>', '\x90')
    >>> tc._evpending()
    False

Cursor (and other special) key sequences work similarly::

    >>> seq = '\x1b[B'
    >>> os.write(f2, seq)
    3
    >>> tc.doRead()
    >>> tc._evpending()
    True
    >>> ev = tc._getevent()
    >>> (repr_keysym(ev[0]), ev[1])
    (u'<Down>', None)
    >>> tc._evpending()
    False

These bytes don't have to all arrive at once, either::

    >>> os.write(f2, seq[0])
    1
    >>> tc.doRead()
    >>> os.write(f2, seq[1:])
    2
    >>> tc.doRead()
    >>> tc._evpending()
    True
    >>> ev = tc._getevent()
    >>> (repr_keysym(ev[0]), ev[1])
    (u'<Down>', None)
    >>> tc._evpending()
    False

But they too must arrive before the timeout fires::

    >>> os.write(f2, seq[:2])
    2
    >>> tc.doRead()
    >>> r.itsLater() # causes previous callback to expire & fire
    >>> os.write(f2, seq[2:])
    1
    >>> tc.doRead()
    >>> tc._evpending()
    True
    >>> ev = tc._getevent()
    >>> (repr_keysym(ev[0]), ev[1])
    (u'<ESC>', None)
    >>> tc._evpending()
    True
    >>> ev = tc._getevent()
    >>> (repr_keysym(ev[0]), ev[1])
    (u'<[>', None)
    >>> tc._evpending()
    True
    >>> ev = tc._getevent()
    >>> (repr_keysym(ev[0]), ev[1])
    (u'B', None)
    >>> tc._evpending()
    False
