Background
----------

From the point of view of the application proper, keyboard input comes
in the form of unicode characters.  Both for regular characters, like
regular ASCII characters, Unicode "foreign" characters, etc, and for
control characters.  For control characters like Tab that have a Unicode
assignment, we use that, for keys that don't (cursors keys, etc), we
have assigned a mapping using Unicode Private Use Area codes (U+ECxx,
specifically). 

We do not use, eg Unicode's ``LEFTWARDS ARROW`` character for the left
cursor key, as it is intended to represent the *symbol* of a left arrow,
not the key.  If the user is using something like Apple's Terminal.app
and uses the "Special Characters" menu to find and insert the Unicode
``LEFTWARDS ARROW``, they expect a left-arrow glyph to be inserted, not
the cursor to move left. 

Since from the point of view of the application the input is in unicode,
hitting ``<^Q> <Left>`` will insert a ``U+ECxx`` character, not an
escape-leftbracket-something that is terminal dependant. 

Keysyms
-------

To make describing input keys easier, TMACS has the notion of "Keysyms",
a (unicode) string containing more human-readable descriptions of key
sequences.  These can be converted back and forth to raw unicode strings.
This is implemented by a pair of functions in the ``tmacs.ui.keys``
module::

    >>> from tmacs.ui.keys import keysym, repr_keysym

``keysym`` converts the friendly "keysym" form to a regular unicode
string, and ``repr_keysym`` converts back to the friendly form.
For an uninteresting string, the results are uninteresting::

    >>> keysym(u'hello!')
    u'hello!'
    >>> repr_keysym(u'hello!')
    u'hello!'

Inside square brackets, Unicode characters may be named by hex number in
a variety of formats::

    >>> keysym(u'[U+0327]')
    u'\u0327'
    >>> keysym(u'[u+0327]')
    u'\u0327'
    >>> keysym(u'[U0327]')
    u'\u0327'
    >>> keysym(u'[u0327]')
    u'\u0327'
    >>> keysym(u'[0327]')
    u'\u0327'
    >>> keysym(u'[327]')
    u'\u0327'
    >>> keysym(u'[U+327]')
    u'\u0327'

Characters also may be named by the Unicode character name (case doesn't
matter)::

    >>> keysym(u'[COMBINING CEDILLA]')
    u'\u0327'
    >>> keysym(u'[Combining Cedilla]')
    u'\u0327'
    >>> keysym(u'[combining cedilla]')
    u'\u0327'

TMACS also defines its own names for some characters, namely control
characters and for the ``U+ECxx`` cursor and control key characters it
defines::

    >>> keysym(u'<Left>')
    u'\uec42'
    >>> keysym(u'<Esc>')
    u'\x1b'

Like the others, these names are also case-insensitve::

    >>> keysym(u'<SPACE>')
    u' '
    >>> keysym(u'<^j>')
    u'\n'

Because the square and angle brackets are used for these purposes in
keysyms, there are also special names for them::

    >>> keysym(u'<[>')
    u'['
    >>> keysym(u'<]>')
    u']'
    >>> keysym('<lt>')
    u'<'
    >>> keysym('<gt>')
    u'>'
    
Of course, trying to use the special characters alone won't work::

    >>> keysym(u'<')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    ValueError: Unterminated <> key symbol
    >>> keysym(u'[')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    ValueError: Unterminated [] key symbol
    
Getting keysms back from a raw unicode string is done with `repr_keysym()`.
For normal characters in a string it just passes them through::

    >>> repr_keysym(u'x')
    u'x'
    >>> repr_keysym(u'abc')
    u'abc'

Control characters are converted as one would expect::

    >>> repr_keysym(u'\r\n\a')
    u'<^M><^J><^G>'

The TMACS-defined key name characters are expanded::

    >>> repr_keysym(u'\uec43')
    u'<Right>'

Unicode characters outside the ASCII range are converted to square
bracket numeric form, for clarity in identifying them::

    >>> repr_keysym(u'\u0327')
    u'[0327]'

Finally the characters used for keysym syntax are quoted::

    >>> repr_keysym(u"<>[]")
    u'<LT><GT><[><]>'

Of course these can all be mixed together::

    >>> repr_keysym(u"a\u0329bc\rx[y]z<\uec43>!")
    u'a[0329]bc<^M>x<[>y<]>z<LT><Right><GT>!'
