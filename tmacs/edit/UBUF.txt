Basics
------

Unicode buffer-gap object implemented in C are provided by the 
``tmacs.edit.ubuf`` module::

    >>> from tmacs.edit.ubuf import ubuf

They can be initialized empty, or with a provided unistring, and len()
works as expected::

    >>> u = ubuf()
    >>> u
    <ubuf len 0 at ...>
    >>> len(u)
    0
    >>> del u
    >>> u = ubuf(u"Hello")
    >>> len(u)
    5

Simple subscripting works on a ubuf, and returns a new unicode string
with a copy of the referenced character. Negative indexes work as
expected (counting from the right side) and out-of-range indexes throw
IndexError::

    >>> u[1]
    u'e'
    >>> u[-1]
    u'o'
    >>> u[2] == u[-2]
    True
    >>> u[42]
    Traceback (most recent call last):
	...
    IndexError: index out of range

Ranges (slices) also work as expected::

    >>> u[1:3]
    u'el'
    >>> u[1:-1]
    u'ell'
    >>> u[3:1]
    u''
    >>> u[:]
    u'Hello'

Except that steps other than 1 are disallowed::

    >>> u[::-1]
    Traceback (most recent call last):
	...
    IndexError: only a step of 1 is supported

Slices can also be set, either replacing text with the same size::

    >>> u[0] = u"h"
    >>> u[:]
    u'hello'

Or replaced with something smaller::

    >>> u[1:-1] = u"ih"
    >>> len(u)
    4

The curious can examine the gap result (for debugging only)::

    >>> u.gapstart, u.gapsize
    (3, 1)

We can see the result on the buffer::

    >>> u[:]
    u'hiho'

Note how retrieving the text moved the gap::

    >>> u.gapstart, u.gapsize
    (4, 1)

Or we can add something larger, that doesn't grow past the original size::

    >>> u[:-1] = u'Hell'
    >>> u[:]
    u'Hello'
    
Or that does, causing the buffer to grow::

    >>> u[len(u):] = u" World"
    >>> len(u)
    11
    >>> u[:]
    u'Hello World'

append(x) is a shorthand for u[len(u):] = x::

    >>> u.append(u"!\n")
    >>> u[:]
    u'Hello World!\n'
    
Deleting a slice also works::

    >>> u.gapstart, u.gapsize
    (13, 62)
    >>> del u[5]
    >>> u.gapstart, u.gapsize
    (5, 63)
    >>> u[:]
    u'HelloWorld!\n'
    >>> u.gapstart, u.gapsize
    (12, 63)
    >>> del u[3:6]
    >>> u.gapstart, u.gapsize
    (3, 66)
    >>> u[:]
    u'Helorld!\n'

 

Encoding, and Strings as Replacement Text
-----------------------------------------

There is an "encoding" attribute of ubuf objects, which is a string that
represents the default encoding when converting to/from byte strings. It
defaults to "utf8", but may be changed (though not deleted)::

    >>> u = ubuf()
    >>> u.encoding
    'utf8'
    >>> u.encoding = 'latin1'
    >>> u.encoding
    'latin1'
    >>> del u.encoding
    Traceback (most recent call last):
	...
    TypeError: Cannot delete the encoding attribute

Although we showed using unicode objects are replacement text above,
regular strings (str objects) may also be used, and will be decoded
using codec specified by "encoding" attribute::

    >>> u.append("Hello World")
    >>> u[:]
    u'Hello World'
    >>> u[5:6] = " There "
    >>> u[:]
    u'Hello There World'

A buffer may also be initialized from a string::

    >>> u = ubuf("Hello World")
    >>> u[:]
    u'Hello World'

Let's demonstrate that the encoding attribute works::

    >>> u.encoding = 'utf16'
    >>> u[:] = '\xff\xfeH\x00e\x00l\x00l\x00o\x00'
    >>> u[:]
    u'Hello'

A ubuf may also be created with a specified encoding::

    >>> u = ubuf('\xff\xfeH\x00o\x00w\x00d\x00y\x00', encoding='utf16')
    >>> u[:]
    u'Howdy'


Read-Only Flag
--------------

A Buffer has an attribute that marks it as read-only, defaulting off::

    >>> u = ubuf(u"This is a test buffer")
    >>> u.read_only
    False

While the flag is off the buffer may be modified, but if the flag is set
an error will be thrown::

    >>> u.append(u", which may be modified")
    >>> u[:]
    u'This is a test buffer, which may be modified'
    >>> u.read_only = True
    >>> u[33:33] = u"not "
    Traceback (most recent call last):
	...
    ReadOnlyBufferError: buffer is read-only
    >>> u[:]
    u'This is a test buffer, which may be modified'

The read-only flag may be set to any true or false value, but only the
truth or falsehood will be remembered:

    >>> u.read_only = ""
    >>> u.read_only
    False
    >>> u.read_only = 1 + 3j
    >>> u.read_only
    True

Once the flag is turned off the buffer may be modified again::

    >>> u.read_only = False
    >>> u.append(u'.')
    >>> u[:]
    u'This is a test buffer, which may be modified.'

However, the attribute may never be deleted::

    >>> del u.read_only
    Traceback (most recent call last):
	...
    TypeError: Cannot delete the read_only attribute
    

Changed Flag
------------

A Buffer has an attribute that marks it as having changed, defaulting off::

    >>> u = ubuf(u"This is a test buffer")
    >>> u.changed
    False

Changes to the buffer set the flag, and it will remain set until cleared::

    >>> u.append(u".")
    >>> u[:]
    u'This is a test buffer.'
    >>> u.changed
    True
    >>> u[-1] = u"!"
    >>> u[:]
    u'This is a test buffer!'
    >>> u.changed
    True
    >>> u.changed = False
    >>> u.changed
    False

Whereupon further modifcations will set it again::

    >>> u[-1] = u"?"
    >>> u[:]
    u'This is a test buffer?'
    >>> u.changed
    True

The flag may be also be set manually, and like the Read-Only flag only
the truth value of the flag is remembered, but it may not be deleted::

    >>> u.changed = []
    >>> u.changed
    False
    >>> u.changed = {1:2}
    >>> u.changed
    True
    >>> del u.changed
    Traceback (most recent call last):
	...
    TypeError: Cannot delete the changed attribute


Misc Attributes
---------------

The tabdispwidth attribute specifies the display width of a tab.
Normally this is 8::

    >>> u.tabdispwidth
    8

This value is used in computations such as of how many display columns
from the start of a line the cursor is. Changing this value is not
recommended as it leads to files that show differently in the editor
than in other people's editors and with `cat`, `more`, etc.


Cut and Copy
------------

There are method to cut or copy directly from a ubuf into a another,
usually dedicated purpose (yank buffer) ubuf::

    >>> u[:] = u"Hello there world.\n"
    >>> y = ubuf()
    >>> y.copyfrom(u, 6, 12)
    >>> u[:]
    u'Hello there world.\n'
    >>> y[:]
    u'there '

By default the text is appended to the target buffer.  When the optional
boolean 4th argument is true, the text is appended to the yank buffer
instead::

    >>> y.copyfrom(u, 6, 12, True)
    >>> u[:]
    u'Hello there world.\n'
    >>> y[:]
    u'there there '

Instead of copying, we can also kill (cut) from the source::

    >>> y.cutfrom(u, 6, 12)
    >>> u[:]
    u'Hello world.\n'
    >>> y[:]
    u'there '

Let's put the cut test back and then show that cut too supports appending::

    >>> u[6:6] = y
    >>> y.cutfrom(u, 11, 17, True)
    >>> u[:]
    u'Hello there.\n'
    >>> y[:]
    u'there  world'
